                <h3 id="h3-introduction">Introduction</h3>
                <p>Bhaskalc is an open-source equation calculator developed for fun. All of our content is avaiable for download so you can view and even contribute to our project. This documentation will also guide you in how to use Bhaskalc properly.</p>
                <a></a>
    
                <h3 id="h3-access">Access Bhaskalc</h3>
                <p>To download Bhaskalc files you can clone <a href="https://github.com/ruymon/BhasKalc">our Github repository</a>. If you are interested in contributing (adding new features or fixing bugs), create your own branch and commit your changes. Your commit will be reviewed and, if approved, added to Bhaskalc.  </p>
                <p>We are more than happy to receive your contributions :)</p>

                <h3 id="h3-how">How to Use</h3>
                <p>First of all, you need to specify which kind of equation you want to calculate - Bhaskalc currently calculates first and second degree equations (lines and parables) - then fill in the coeficients from your equation in their respective fields. If your equation doesn't have a certain coeficient, please enter 0 instead of leaving blank. Now you should be ready to press Calculate.</p>

                <p>Bhaskalc will show different results depending on the type of equation you've entered. Choosing a second-degree equation calculates it's roots, delta, vertexes, discriminant and instersection with Y-axis, while choosing first-degree equations will calculate:</p>

                <p>For easier visualization, thanks to an open-source library, we have implemented a dynamic graph that precisely represents your equation.</p>
